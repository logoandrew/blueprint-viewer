INITIAL BLUEPRINT CREATION (REPEAT FOR EACH SECTION)
======================================================

1) Save, Commit, and Merge branches to the master.

2) Open the page as untracked from the master.

3) Run the "Add Artboard Borders & Titles" plugin to add Borders
and again to add Titles (using these settings: border width: 1, 
border color: #7f7f7f, font: Arvo, font size: 32, line height: 36, 
vertical space: 20).
plugin: https://github.com/yuanqing/sketch-plugins/tree/master/packages/sketch-add-artboard-borders-and-titles

4) Run the "Sketch Commands > Export > Whole Page to Desktop as PNG" 
plugin. This will create a 'page.png' file on your desktop.
plugin: https://github.com/bomberstudios/sketch-commands

5) Rename the page.png file to page{XX}.png where {XX} is the page 
number (ie. page01.png).

6) Open the png with Photoshop.

7) Add a solid white layer behind the original trasparent layer, 
and flatten.

8) OPTIONAL (to save filesize and upload time): scale down the image
so that the total number of pixels is around 250 million. For example:
Original image is 11,000 x 33,000 pixels for a total of 363 million pixels.
If it's scaled down to 85% (11,000 * 33,000 * .85 * .85), the total number
of pixels becomes 262 million.

9) Save the png. (These original png files can be combined at the end to make the final PDF proof)

10) Export the file as a Zoomify image (File > Export > Zoomify...).
Settings: Template: Zoomify Viewer (White Background), Output folder: I recommend 
a dedicated folder on your desktop just for this (something like Blueprint Export), 
Base Name: can be the same as the png, Image Quality: 10, Browser Options: 9999 x 9999 pixels.
Hit OK, this could take a few minutes depending on your computer and file size.
This will generate a few files: a folder with the page name (this is what you'll need),
an html and javacript file (these are junk).

  a) at this point, I like to add "v1" to the generated folder name (to keep track of the page 
  versions/revisions; "page01v1.png" for example)

11) Repeat steps 2â€“10 for all pages (no need to include empty/unused pages).

12) Move all generated folders to their respective locations (Blueprints > {Blueprint_folder} > img).

13) Set up this Blueprint Viewer:

14) In a text/code editor edit the "config_EDIT.php" file:

  a) Make sure that each blueprint has its own variable name and settings ('bp1' => [...], 'bp2' => [...], etc.), 
  remove any unnecessary blueprints (including the comma after the last blueprint bracket).
  Note: the Core page counts as its own blueprint.

  b) 'blueprint_folder' is the exact naming of this blueprint's folder (located inside the "Blueprints" folder).
  Named as {blueprint-number}_{brand}_{palette}.

  c) 'brand' is the brand that appears in the dropdown menu. (usually the client name)

  d) 'palette' is the palette that appears in the dropdown menu. (usually the year)

  e) 'num_pages' is the number of pages in this one specific blueprint

  f) 'page_name_override' is used if there are additional pages or if a default page is different than normal.

  g) 'google_link' is the url of the client report questionnaire; set to FALSE if unavailable.

15) For each blueprint folder (from 13.b), edit the "EDIT_ME.js" file:

  a) Make sure that each page has its own variable name and settings (page1: {...}, page2: {...}, etc.), 
  add any additional pages. NOTE: variable names (page1) are numbered to this specific blueprint; 
  folder names (page02v1) are numbered according to their place in all blueprints combined.

  b) Edit each page's settings (following the notes at the top).

    1) If a page is NOT available in the system, mark 'available' as false;

    2) Find the png's (from step 9) dimensions (right click
    on file > Get Info > More Info > Dimensions)

    3) 'imgFolder' should correspond to the folder name/location for each page.

16) Save 'EDIT_ME.js'.

17) If adding a page, make sure the {blueprint_folder} has a .php file for the new page 
(just duplicate and edit an existing .php file).

18) Now to upload!

19) Open FileZilla (program can be downloaded here:
https://filezilla-project.org/download.php)

20) Connect to studio.ovrture 
(see instructions tab on google sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c71kTnk1M6Y1bWTSNLpX47Fen-C-3U3wOoI82_i_lRM/edit?usp=sharing)

  * on first run) In the menubar select FileZilla > Settings...,
    select Transfers and make sure 'Maximum simultaneous transfers'
    is set to 5, then click OK.

21) Create a new client listing following the Studio Access
List google sheet instructions.

22) Rename this blueprint viewer's root folder with the hashed password.

23) Drag entire folder into the /var/www/ovrture folder.

24) Wait for queued files to finish uploading (could take a while)

25) Go to https://studio.ovrture.com/, enter the unencrypted password, and test
out the viewer. If something appears off, check the settings in the
EDIT_ME file of corresponding section.
